# NEWS-PUBLICATION-COMPANY-RETENTION-MODEL

A Newspaper Publishing Company (NPC) is facing increasing churn rates since years. This evolution has been jumpstarted by the rise of news- websites, and has continued at an accelerating rate due to the popularity of tablet computers and (social) news- aggregator applications.

Hence the NPC requires a predictive retention (or churn) model in order to predict which customers will not renew their newspaper subscriptionss. Customers are not allowed to cancel their subscriptions;hence a customer is defined as a churner if he or she does not renew the subscription once the current subscriptions end.
